# Pangpang

This project is about my cat Pangpang. It is an Angular SPA which includes Pangpang's self-introduction (carousel on home page), Pangpang's quotes (fetch inspirational quotes data from API), Pangpang's favorite food and things (demonstrated in progress bars and tables using Angular services), and about author.

Generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.6.
